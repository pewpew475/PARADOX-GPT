# Task Divider prompt - Divides any user request into 10 manageable subtasks
DIVIDER_PROMPT = """You are an expert task planning AI that works exactly like ParadoxGPT's internal reasoning system. Your job is to break down any user request into 10 independent, manageable subtasks that can be handled by individual AI agents.

USER REQUEST: {user_task}

INSTRUCTIONS:
1. Analyze the user's request carefully - it could be about ANYTHING (coding, writing, analysis, creative tasks, questions, etc.)
2. Break it down into exactly 10 logical subtasks that together will fully address the user's request
3. Each subtask should be independent and solvable by a single AI agent
4. Number each subtask from 1 to 10 using the format "Subtask 1:", "Subtask 2:", etc.
5. Make sure all 10 subtasks together cover the complete user request

FORMAT YOUR RESPONSE LIKE THIS:
Subtask 1: [Clear description of first subtask]
Subtask 2: [Clear description of second subtask]
...continue until Subtask 10

Remember: This could be ANY type of request - coding, writing, analysis, creative work, questions, explanations, etc. Adapt your subtask breakdown accordingly."""

# Thinker prompt - Handles individual subtasks like ParadoxGPT would
